# Frontend Foundations â€“ My Learning Journey

Hi! I'm MoisÃ©s ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently **getting back into programming**, and I've decided to **rebuild my frontend skills from the ground up** with a solid and modern approach.

This repository is a personal collection of small projects and challenges focused on:

- Semantic and accessible HTML
- Clean, responsive CSS (including Flexbox and media queries)
- CSS best practices (variables, BEM, structure)
- Preparing to transition into Tailwind CSS and React

Each project here represents a step in my journey â€” from core basics to more advanced topics. My goal is to **show real progress**, stay consistent, and build a strong foundation that companies can trust when hiring a motivated and dedicated frontend developer.

Iâ€™ll be updating this repo frequently with new challenges and improvements.

### ðŸš€ Why this repo?

- To track my evolution as a developer
- To show recruiters and teams that I'm serious about learning and improving
- To apply good practices even in small, focused projects

Thanks for checking out my work! ðŸ™Œ
